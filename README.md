# TerrainGeneration
 Procedural Terrain Generation with OpenGL.
 
 # About
 I wanted a project where I could learn more about OpenGL and terrain generation seemed cool. This program uses 2D perlin noise to deform a triangle based plane. All of the noise generation, vertex shifting, and biome representation are doen in shaders. I plan to add a moisture noise pattern for more interesting biomes, animated water, better lighting, higher resolution meshes, and more.
